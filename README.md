# Group Shuffle
This is a code for shuffling group when we got project assignment in school or college. 
I build this project using python

### How to use:
- You can make a txt file that contains names of the group you want to shuffle
- Change the file path on file code with your file txt's name
- Running the code
- Then the output will be the csv file with shuffling group
